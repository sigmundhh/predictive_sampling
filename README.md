# Predictive Sampling
A minimal implementation of Predictive Sampling, as described in "Predictive Sampling: Real-time Behaviour Synthesis with MuJoCo" by DeepMind. 
The repo is constructed primarily for a personal introduction to MPC and its strengths and weaknesses.

## Cartpole experiment
Using the cart pole environment from this [repo](https://github.com/0xangelo/gym-cartpole-swingup) and its dynamical model, I made an implementation of Predictive Sampling for this setup.

The script shows the simulation environment along with the predicted trajectories:
